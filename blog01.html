  <h4>Compromise</h4>
  <p> Reading Walter Issacson's words on Steve Jobs brought to my attention that Jobs rose from an era born of rebellion and desire for change. The Apple I released a year before Star Wars, in 1976. Industries were transforming drastically, and due to singular vision. Maintaining end to end control of any product is essential. If you think a product should be a way, then it should be that way. A leader's vision should only be challenged through intense argument. If the passion between ideas isn't equal, than the idea with more passion from it's leader should win. This is why the Apple II is the last Apple computer with slots.</p>
<p> Recognize that since 2011, Apple has managed to revolutionize 2-4 more lanes of technology. The Apple Watch, AirPods...and to a lesser extent iPhone and iPad. The Apple Watch is the highest selling watch (last I checked). AirPods are the most popular headphone (you can't go outside for over an hour without seeing a pair). iPhone X finally made a significant design leap with the 'all screen' aesthetic. The iPad Pro became the go to student notetaking device, close to what Jobs' direction for the product as a textbook replacement intended.</p>
<p> I remember the iPhone X reveal in 2017, and there hasn't been that level of hype for something in my lifetime to that degree. People of status wanted it to show they could afford it. People like me couldn't afford it at the moment, but knew the $1000 price was monumental. I never opposed the cost, because I understood it. New technology that's exciting should come at a price. People should be hungry and starving themselves to access it, and if they won't--the product isn't cool enough. </p>
<p> I remember The Force Awakens in 2015, and my disapointment on the second viewing, I didn't like it--everyone else loved it. Why? Because I'd seen the movie. Everyone has seen the movie, some even in 1977. The most exciting change to Star Wars was in 2017 with the Last Jedi, even though the film wasn't close to perfect, it still brought nuance to the universe--and people hated it. Disney caved under pressure, allowing the franchise to return to safety, now following the model of Marvel's boring formulaic universe. </p>
<p> Both of these properties are on opposite ends of the compromise spectrum. Apple stood by the $1000 iPhone, like Jobs certainly would have. Disney went back on their decision to expieriment when they saw a flicker of backlash from The Last Jedi. George Lucas wasn't afraid to get weird with Star Wars, just watch the Mortis arc in The Clone Wars. People didn't like Ahsoka, now she's a fan favorite. The difference is, Jobs built the team that would ensure Apple's future, Lucas didn't--he sold.</p>
<p> Still, Apple and Star Wars shouldn't be nearly as hyped as they are at this point. Things should change, and it's strange that products of the 1970s are still controlling societal tastes today. It also occured to me that the most exciting space endevour was in 1977 with the launches of Voyager 1 & 2. We had the confidence to put the sounds of earth and our exact location on a record and shoot it beyond our solar system. Ever since the '70s, I think we've been scared to go past safety. Everything has evolved so carefully that we don't push for the uncomfortable. I would happily die from the blasts of an alien spaceship as a result of the records aboard Voyager 1 & 2. The alternative is a death where I'd be forever unsatisifed humanity ignored an opportunity to prove the existance of alien life.</p>
<p> Instead of a conclusion, I've come to more of a question. Will you live your life based on survival, or will you risk losing it all to discovery?</p>
