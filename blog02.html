				<h5>Strange New Worlds</h5>
				<p>People come and go. At all times. Lifelong friends are mostly built on loyalty and being likable, I can’t think of much else holding people together longterm when their ideals are constantly being tested or shifting–same with interests. 18-19 years in so far and already see that most people have very very little in common with their friends. Some share similar work ethics, but there’s a lot of cases where that’s coincidental just based on 99% of the population being lazy. Not sure if lazy is the right word, or if a better way of division is to say that the 99% have succumbed to sedation. The other 1% enjoy the alternative dopamine rush that is scrapping for accomplishment.</p>
				<p>The sedation I’m referring to isn’t a natural occurrence, more of a commercial abuse of natural instinct. There’s a cancerous evolution of content people consume, dangerously fast paced and attention grabbing that users get addicted to whatever medium they’re consuming said content on. Captions to read, vibrant colors, quick cuts; you’ve seen it. They’re tricked into productivity by consuming more and more, thinking they’re being ultra efficient. I can consume twice as fast on 2x speed, so if I talk in person I’m just wasting time. </p>
				<p>None of this is to say social networking or media is outright bad. I mean, yes, it probably is, but you have to acknowledge the benefits before writing it off completely. The internet is basically the same as social media anyway, and soon enough social media will make websites completely irrelevant. </p>
				<p>Back to friendship. Most of my first close friends were made online, and those ones I have common interests with (which is why for me they’re the closest of friends). It’s important to put into perspective that these people live nowhere near me. People I’ve befriended normally only have the traits in Paragraph 1, with 1-2 exceptions. That makes this whole thing inconclusive.</p>
