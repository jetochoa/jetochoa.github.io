				<h5>Other People</h5>
				<p>As someone who says people don’t bother me, people really do bother me.</p>
				<p>Someone else’s opinion can kinda be inconvenient. I mean, there’s just not much else to it. Imagine you have (groundbreaking) ideas and they want to go with what’s always worked. It’s not going to just keep working. Look how fast social media platforms (that host millions of people come and go?) Who is cool that still uses Facebook?</p>
				<p>There’s still entire companies running Facebook ads instead of migrating to TikTok ads. I didn’t start using TikTok until maybe a month ago, out of ignorance. Once I did I saw the beauty of it, well it’s actually not very beautiful–more so impressively addictive. Which is why it’s perfect for business/personal growth. I would’ve completely missed out on the rapid levels of growth I’ve experienced there if I had continued to live in comfort with familiarity.</p>
