				<h5>A Balance</h5>
				<p>Getting complacent has beat the hell out of me, can’t lie.</p>
				<p>Since leaving school,  any opportunity for social interactions is eaten up by my mind. I’m spending just as much energy on developing my primary focus (music) as I am on course correction. “Course correction” is not allowing myself to be content staying in a set social environment (like a workplace). I feel almost forced into finding negatives with a situation so I’m able to obsess on the goal further.</p>
				<p>So should I be excited to go to work? Yes and no. Going to work gives me money, which I use to fund projects, and I have the most social fun when I’m there. Why am I not excited? Because I should be farther in my career projection than I am. Being at work is a reminder that I’m still stuck in the system. There is no real freedom. The difficulty is that positive memories stick with me, and the happier I am the less I feel the hunger to succeed. Everything is just about keeping the hunger alive.</p>
				<p>Happy enough to be healthily able to continue, but hungry enough to need (not want) to keep going.</p>
